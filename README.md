# Modelling the progression of world records in athletics - Events over middle distances
## Introduction
This data analysis project has substantial focus on the modelling of progression of world record
times in athletics for sprint race events for middle distances for men and women. A study of record
times over the years can provide useful insights about the structure of the variation of world record
times which can be useful guidance to future athletes. The research aims to explain the variation
in the world record times over time.
